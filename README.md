# Falling Leaves

This Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.16.x adds a neat little particle effect to leaf blocks. Users can configure which types of leaf blocks will drop leaves and the frequency that these leaves are dropped at.

## FAQ

- Is this compatible with `<insert mod name here>`?
    - We can't be 100% sure, but it definitely **should** be, assuming the mod has been designed correctly. (Developer notes: So long as your leaf block correctly extends `net.minecraft.block.LeavesBlock`, we should be 100% compatible.)
- Does this need to be installed on the server for multiplayer?
    - Nope! This mod is 100% client-side and should work fine no matter what. Servers should ignore this mod during startup.
- Lol fabric suxxx gief forge plx.
    - That's not a question. Also, no. Feel free to port it to Forge if you want to, though!
- Do you have any screenshots I could look at before I install this?
    - Sure! Check out the [images section](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-fabric/screenshots) of this mod's Curseforge page.
- I enjoy old things. Can you backport this to Minecraft v1.7?
    - No. We will only focus on supporting the most recently released version of Minecraft.
- I found a problem! Do I just post a comment on your CurseForge page?
    - You **could**, but we'd prefer it if you posted an issue on [our GitHub repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/issues). It makes it far easier for us to follow up when developing new versions of this mod.
- I have an idea for something you could do with this mod!
    - Great, we're always happy to hear you out! Use the issue tracker on our Github Repo to post your suggestions.
- Can I include this mod in my modpack?
    - Absolutely! Just remember to put a link to our Curseforge page somewhere in your modpack's documentation.
- What do you get if you jumble the letters in "Falling Leaves Mod"?
    - You get "Five Golden Llamas". We're still not sure if this means anything in particular...
