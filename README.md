# Falling Leaves

This Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.16.x adds a neat little particle effect to leaf blocks. Users can configure which types of leaf blocks will drop leaves and the frequency that these leaves are dropped at.

## FAQ

- Is this compatible with `<insert mod name here>`?
    - We can't be 100% sure, but it definitely **should** be, assuming the mod has been designed correctly. (Developer notes: So long as your leaf block correctly extends `net.minecraft.block.LeavesBlock`, we should be 100% compatible.)
- Does this need to be installed on the server for multiplayer?
  - Nope! This mod is 100% client-side and should work fine no matter what. Servers should ignore this mod during
    startup.
- Is there a fabric version of this?
  - Yes there
    is [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-forge) [Github](https://github.com/Cheaterpaul/fallingleaves)
    by Fourmisain, BrekiTomasson and RandomMcSomethin
- Do you have any screenshots I could look at before I install this?
  - Sure! Check out the [images section](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-forge/screenshots)
    of this mod's Curseforge page.
- I enjoy old things. Can you backport this to Minecraft v1.7?
    - No. We will only focus on supporting the most recently released version of Minecraft.
- I found a problem! Do I just post a comment on your CurseForge page?
  - You **could**, but we'd prefer it if you posted an issue
    on [our GitHub repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/Cheaterpaul/fallingleaves/issues). It makes it far
    easier for us to follow up when developing new versions of this mod.
- I have an idea for something you could do with this mod!
    - Great, we're always happy to hear you out! Use the issue tracker on our Github Repo to post your suggestions.
- Can I include this mod in my modpack?
    - Absolutely! Just remember to put a link to our Curseforge page somewhere in your modpack's documentation.
- What do you get if you jumble the letters in "Falling Leaves Mod"?
    - You get "Five Golden Llamas". We're still not sure if this means anything in particular...
  
## Thanks and Credits

All good developers learn from reading code other people have written, and it's only fair to credit those who have inspired us. For that reason, we give thanks to:

- Fourmisain, BrekiTomasson and RandomMcSomethin, who coded the mod for fabric from where I copied the leaf animations
  and related non forge requirements
